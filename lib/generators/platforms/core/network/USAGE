Description:
    Create a Network model, and include the relevant Platforms::Core Concern.
    This will also set the relevant Network configuration in
    config/initializers/plaforms_core.rb.

Example:
    rails generate platforms:core:network blah more_info:string

    This will create the Blah model, including migration, and test suite.
    It will have a string column called "more_info".
    The concern is then included in app/models/blah.rb

    Also works for namespaced models, and accepts similar arguments
    as the ActiveRecord generator (database columns, associations).
